## API Optimization

### Asynchronous Processing

**Q: Can you provide a specific example of how you implemented asynchronous processing in a FastAPI application? What challenges did you face, and how did you address them?**

**A:** I implemented async endpoints in FastAPI to handle concurrent requests for a logging API. For example, a `POST /log-event` endpoint used `async def` with `aiohttp` to fetch external data and `aiosqlite` for non-blocking database writes. Challenges included managing async context for database connections. I addressed this by using `async with` context managers to ensure proper resource cleanup, reducing connection leaks and improving throughput by 30%.

**Q: How do you decide when to use async vs. sync endpoints in FastAPI? What trade-offs have you encountered in high-traffic scenarios?**

**A:** Async endpoints are ideal for I/O-bound tasks like database queries or API calls, while sync endpoints suit CPU-bound tasks like heavy computations. In high-traffic scenarios, async endpoints reduce latency but increase complexity due to async/await syntax. I use `httpx.AsyncClient` for external calls and profile with `cProfile` to confirm async benefits outweigh overhead, ensuring scalability without excessive memory usage.

**Q: How would you handle error propagation in async FastAPI endpoints, especially for an AI firewall logging system?**

**A:** I use `try-except` blocks within async endpoints to catch exceptions like database errors or invalid inputs. For an AI firewall, I’d implement custom exception handlers in FastAPI to return standardized error responses (e.g., 400 for invalid data). Errors are logged to a database table with fields like `error_code` and `timestamp` using `aiosqlite` for async writes, ensuring reliable error tracking without blocking the event loop.

### Caching

**Q: Can you walk us through a caching strategy you’ve implemented with Redis for a high-traffic API? How did you determine cache eviction policies?**

**A:** For a high-traffic API, I used Redis to cache frequently accessed data, like security event summaries. I implemented a key-value store with `redis-py`, setting keys like `event:severity:high` with a TTL of 5 minutes. Eviction policies were based on access frequency, using LRU (Least Recently Used) to prioritize recent queries. This reduced database load by 40%, with Redis handling 80% of read requests.

**Q: How would you invalidate cache for an AI firewall system when new security events are logged?**

**A:** I’d use an event-driven approach, invalidating cache keys (e.g., `event:severity:high`) when a `POST /log-event` request adds a new event. Using Redis pub/sub, the API publishes an invalidation message on event creation, triggering cache updates. For consistency, I’d use a write-through cache for critical data, ensuring new events are immediately reflected while maintaining low latency.

**Q: What are the security implications of caching sensitive data, like security logs, in Redis? How would you mitigate risks?**

**A:** Caching sensitive data risks exposure if Redis is compromised. I’d mitigate this by enabling TLS encryption for Redis connections, using ACLs to restrict access, and avoiding caching sensitive fields like user IDs. Data is sanitized before caching, and keys are hashed to obscure identifiers. Regular audits with tools like `redis-cli` ensure no unauthorized access, maintaining security for an AI firewall system.

### Load Balancing

**Q: Can you describe a time when you configured a load balancer for a high-traffic API? What specific settings did you tweak to optimize performance?**

**A:** I configured an AWS ELB for a REST API, using round-robin distribution to balance traffic across three EC2 instances. I tweaked health check intervals to 10 seconds and set a 500ms latency threshold to detect unhealthy instances. Sticky sessions were enabled for user consistency, and connection draining was set to 30 seconds to prevent request drops during scaling, improving uptime by 15%.

**Q: How would you handle session persistence in a load-balanced API for an AI firewall system?**

**A:** For session persistence, I’d use token-based authentication with JWTs stored in client cookies or headers, avoiding server-side session storage. The load balancer routes requests based on tokens, ensuring stateless API design. If sticky sessions are needed, I’d configure the load balancer to use cookie-based routing, minimizing session loss while maintaining scalability.

**Q: What metrics would you monitor to ensure a load balancer is effectively distributing traffic for an API under high load?**

**A:** I’d monitor request latency, error rates (e.g., 5xx responses), and target group health using metrics from the load balancer (e.g., AWS CloudWatch). Additional metrics include request rate per instance and CPU utilization to detect uneven distribution. Alerts are set for latency >1s or error rates >2%, ensuring balanced traffic and quick issue detection.

## ML Pipeline Optimization

### Model Efficiency

**Q: Can you share an example of how you applied model pruning or quantization in an ML project? What was the impact on performance?**

**A:** I applied model pruning to a Random Forest classifier for anomaly detection, removing 20% of low-importance features using scikit-learn’s feature importance. Quantization reduced model weights to 8-bit integers with PyTorch’s `torch.quantization`. This cut inference time by 35% and model size by 50%, enabling real-time predictions on edge devices with minimal accuracy loss.

**Q: How do you balance model accuracy and inference speed when optimizing for an AI firewall’s real-time requirements?**

**A:** I prioritize simpler models like Logistic Regression for low-latency tasks, reserving complex models (e.g., deep learning) for high-accuracy needs. Hyperparameter tuning, such as reducing layers or nodes, optimizes speed. I use cross-validation to ensure accuracy loss is <5%, meeting real-time requirements for an AI firewall while maintaining reliable predictions.

**Q: What tools or frameworks have you used to profile ML model performance in a production environment?**

**A:** I use PyTorch Profiler to measure inference latency and memory usage, identifying bottlenecks in data loading or model layers. TensorBoard visualizes training and inference metrics. For production, I integrate with Prometheus to track latency and resource usage, ensuring models meet performance SLAs.

### Batching

**Q: Can you describe a scenario where you implemented batching in an ML pipeline? How did it impact throughput?**

**A:** I implemented batching in a time-series forecasting pipeline using PyTorch, processing 64 samples per batch. This reduced overhead from per-sample inference, increasing throughput by 40%. Batch size was tuned via experimentation to balance GPU memory limits and latency, ensuring efficient processing for high-traffic data streams.

**Q: How do you handle variable-sized inputs when batching data for an ML model in a high-traffic system?**

**A:** I use padding to standardize input sizes (e.g., zero-padding sequences) or bucketing to group similar-sized inputs. For example, in a text classification pipeline, I padded inputs to the max sequence length in a batch. This ensured consistent tensor shapes, reducing processing errors and maintaining throughput under high load.

**Q: What are the trade-offs of increasing batch size in an ML pipeline for an AI firewall system?**

**A:** Larger batch sizes improve throughput by reducing per-batch overhead but increase memory usage and latency. For an AI firewall, I’d cap batch sizes at 128 to balance real-time requirements, monitoring GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`. Smaller batches are used for low-latency needs, ensuring timely security event processing.

### Parallelization

**Q: Can you provide an example of how you used Apache Spark for parallelizing an ML pipeline? What challenges did you encounter?**

**A:** I used Spark’s MLlib to parallelize feature extraction for a classification pipeline across a 10-node cluster. Data was partitioned by event ID, and Spark’s RDDs handled distributed preprocessing. Challenges included data skew, which I mitigated by repartitioning data evenly, improving processing time by 25% and ensuring scalability.

**Q: How would you decide between Spark and other parallelization frameworks (e.g., Dask) for an ML pipeline in a cloud-native environment?**

**A:** Spark is ideal for large-scale, fault-tolerant data processing with robust ecosystem support, while Dask suits smaller clusters with Python-native workflows. For a cloud-native ML pipeline, I’d choose Spark for its integration with AWS EMR and resilience, switching to Dask for lightweight tasks to reduce setup overhead.

**Q: How do you ensure data consistency when parallelizing ML preprocessing for security event analysis?**

**A:** I use Spark’s deterministic partitioning (e.g., by hash of event ID) to ensure consistent data splits across nodes. For security events, I apply write-ahead logging to a database before processing, ensuring no data loss. Consistency is verified with checksums on processed data, maintaining integrity in distributed environments.

## Database Optimization

### Indexing and Query Optimization

**Q: Can you share an example of how you optimized a database query for a high-traffic application? What was the performance gain?**

**A:** I optimized a PostgreSQL query for fetching security logs by adding a composite index on `timestamp` and `severity`. The query used a `WHERE` clause for filtering, reducing execution time from 2s to 200ms (90% improvement). `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` was used to identify scan types, ensuring index usage.

**Q: How would you design indexes for a security event logging database to support fast filtering by severity and timestamp?**

**A:** I’d create a composite index on `(severity, timestamp)` in PostgreSQL to optimize range queries and filtering (e.g., `WHERE severity = 'high' AND timestamp > '2025-05-01'`). A B-tree index supports efficient sorting and filtering, with periodic index maintenance to prevent bloat in high-traffic systems.

**Q: What are the risks of over-indexing in a relational database, and how do you mitigate them?**

**A:** Over-indexing increases write latency and storage usage. I mitigate this by analyzing query patterns with `EXPLAIN` to identify necessary indexes, dropping unused ones. For high-traffic systems, I limit indexes to frequently queried columns and monitor performance with `pg_stat_statements`.

### Connection Pooling

**Q: Can you describe how you implemented connection pooling in a high-traffic backend application? What tools or libraries did you use?**

**A:** I used SQLAlchemy’s connection pool with FastAPI to manage PostgreSQL connections. The pool was configured with a max size of 20 connections and a recycle time of 3600s to prevent stale connections. This reduced connection overhead by 50%, supporting high-traffic API requests.

**Q: How do you configure connection pool settings (e.g., max connections) for a high-traffic API? What factors do you consider?**

**A:** I configure max connections based on traffic volume, server CPU cores, and database capacity. For a high-traffic API, I set a pool size of 20–50, with a timeout of 5s to prevent blocking. I monitor connection usage with `pg_stat_activity` to adjust settings dynamically.

**Q: How would you handle connection pool exhaustion in a production environment for an AI firewall system?**

**A:** I’d monitor pool usage with Prometheus and set alerts for connection counts nearing max limits. On exhaustion, I’d scale database instances or increase max connections if server resources allow. Fallbacks include queuing requests with Celery, ensuring the AI firewall remains responsive. traffic systems like AI firewall logging, I monitor index hit rates and update indexes during low-traffic windows to minimize impact.

**Q: Can you explain how connection pooling improves performance in a high-concurrency API? What tools or libraries have you used?**

**A:** Connection pooling reduces the overhead of repeatedly opening and closing database connections. In a FastAPI app, I used `asyncpg` with `Databases` and `SQLAlchemy` to maintain a pool of up to 20 connections. This allowed concurrent queries without saturating the DB, improving response times by 35% during peak load.

**Q: How would you configure connection pooling for a FastAPI application deployed in Kubernetes?**

**A:** I configure pooling using environment variables (e.g., `POOL_SIZE=20`) and use a readiness probe to delay traffic until the pool is ready. Kubernetes limits pod-level concurrency using CPU/memory limits, ensuring the pool doesn’t exhaust DB resources. Health checks monitor pool size and failed connection attempts.

**Q: What issues can arise with connection pooling in an async application and how would you debug them?**

**A:** Common issues include exhausted pools and connection leaks. I enable query logging and track active connections with database metrics (`pg_stat_activity`). Using `async with` ensures connections are properly released. Timeouts and retry logic are configured to prevent API hangs during pool exhaustion.

## Containerization and Scalability

### Docker and Kubernetes

**Q: Describe your approach to containerizing a machine learning pipeline. What best practices did you follow to optimize container performance?**

**A:** I use multi-stage Docker builds: the first stage installs dependencies, and the second copies only necessary files and the model. I use a slim base image (e.g., `python:3.10-slim`), minimize layers, and pin versions for reproducibility. I also set `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` and `CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app"]` for consistent logging and startup.

**Q: How would you deploy a FastAPI + ML inference service using Kubernetes for high availability?**

**A:** I deploy using a Deployment with multiple replicas and a LoadBalancer service. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales based on CPU usage. I mount the ML model from a shared volume or S3 and ensure rolling updates with readiness and liveness probes. Resource limits prevent a single pod from consuming too much memory.

**Q: What strategies would you use to manage model versioning and rollout in a Kubernetes environment?**

**A:** I use image tags (e.g., `inference:v1.2.3`) and manage versions via Helm values or Kustomize overlays. Canary deployments allow routing a small percentage of traffic to the new model version. Prometheus/Grafana monitors performance metrics like accuracy drift or latency, allowing rollback on degradation.

## Monitoring and Profiling

**Q: What tools do you use to monitor API performance in production? How do you respond to performance regressions?**

**A:** I use Prometheus + Grafana to monitor API latency, error rates, and throughput. Alerts are configured for p95 latency or 5xx errors. For profiling regressions, I use `py-spy` and `cProfile` in a staging environment. Regressions are rolled back automatically via CI/CD and root cause analysis is done before redeployment.

**Q: How do you monitor ML inference quality and latency over time?**

**A:** I log inference latency and model output using OpenTelemetry. Latency histograms help detect anomalies, while model predictions are audited with ground-truth comparisons when available. Accuracy drift triggers a retraining pipeline. Logs are centralized with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for alerting and investigation.

**Q: How would you trace and debug a slow endpoint in a FastAPI application under real traffic?**

**A:** I use distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger to follow request flow across services. I add middleware to log timestamps before and after DB queries and model inference. I also enable `uvicorn` access logs and use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow queries to isolate the bottleneck.
