###API Optimization:
Asynchronous Processing: I’d use FastAPI with async endpoints to handle concurrent requests efficiently, reducing response times. For example, at Cariad, I optimized a Python-based KPI analysis framework for time-series data, improving efficiency by 20% through async processing with Pandas.
Caching: Implement caching with Redis or in-memory stores to reduce database load for frequently accessed data, like security event logs in an AI firewall system. This ensures low latency for repeated queries.
Load Balancing: Deploy the API behind a load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed. I’ve worked with hybrid cloud setups at Porsche, integrating CI/CD pipelines with AWS.
